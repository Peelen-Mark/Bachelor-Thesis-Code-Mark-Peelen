# Bachelor-Thesis-Code-Mark-Peelen

During my bachelor thesis, I utilized the following code to gather my results. The code heavily relies on the MDICC method, which can be referenced as:

"Yang, Y., Tian, S., Qiu, Y., Zhao, P., & Zou, Q. (2022). MDICC: Novel method for multi-omics data integration and cancer subtype identification. Briefings in Bioinformatics, 23(3), bbac132."

To execute this code, it is necessary to download the code from the aforementioned paper, as it provides the functions used in the "code_modification_fusion_thesis_mark_peelen_s1041475.R" file. Additionally, the data utilized in this study was obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Specifically, I worked with the following ten cancer types:

- BRCA
- KIRC
- LUAD
- LIHC
- GBM
- LUSC
- SARC
- OV
- AML
- SKCM
For successful execution of the code, please ensure that the ipynb file is run first, and the resulting .csv files are placed in the appropriate directory to be compatible with the R file. If you need access to the original datasets, please contact me.
